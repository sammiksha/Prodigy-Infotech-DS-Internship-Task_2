Task 02 – Data Cleaning &amp; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed data cleaning and EDA on the dataset to analyze survival patterns and relationships between variables using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
📌 Task 02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This task focuses on performing data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to understand data structure, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

🔍 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and inconsistencies

Perform univariate analysis to study individual feature distributions

Conduct bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables

Visualize insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

📊 Key Insights

Survival distribution shows a higher number of non-survivors

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males

Passenger age and fare reveal important trends related to survival

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

This task demonstrates the importance of EDA in understanding real-world datasets and building a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making.
